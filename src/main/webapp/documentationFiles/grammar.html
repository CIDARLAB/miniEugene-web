<h4>The Grammar of the miniEugene Language</h4>

<p>miniEugene supports the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunctive_normal_form" target="_blank">conjunctive normal form</a>, i.e., a conjunction of disjunctions. 
A line feed indicates a conjunction.
<br/><br/>
The grammar of the miniEugene language is specified in the Extended Backus-Naur Form (EBNF). 
Words in double-quotes (e.g. "NOT") are reserved words, must be specified, and cannot be used as IDs.
The question mark character ('?') denotes optional words and the pipe character ('|') denotes selections.
