# Multiple Traces

<img src="multiple_traces.png" width="400px"/>

This example uses trace-based renderers for the genetic design that show part length at nucleotide resolution. This allows for associated data, such as the traces below, to corrispond directly to functional elements of the design. The genetic design is part of variant 75 of a re-factored nitrogen fixation pathway taken from Smanski et al. 2014.
